The AI engineer systematically evolved the NutriKids AI application through several key phases. Initially, work focused on enhancing gamification, incorporating points, levels, and badges, along with a Test/Demo mode for quick verification. This included UI updates in  and integration into  and . An onboarding slide was also added to introduce gamification. Subsequently, UX/UI was refined with a scalable dropdown for language selection and advanced animations for progress bars and buttons. A major task involved integrating a full Stripe payment system for Premium subscriptions, including dynamic pricing fetched from the admin panel and crucial bug fixes related to database interaction and navigation. The final phase began an Audit Completo, addressing core stability. This involved comprehensive backend testing, implementing password recovery, and robust error handling. The most recent discussion centered on enhancing food recognition with a hybrid LogMeal + GPT-4o system, and then on the process of saving and continuing work.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in discussions about the app's potential for growth, drawing comparisons to Cal.ai, and the user's strong desire for the app to be perfecta. This led to a comprehensive audit of the application, identifying areas for improvement across UI/UX, viral growth, monetization enforcement, retention, and production readiness.

The AI engineer proposed a multi-phase Piano Perfezione and the user agreed to start with **FASE 1: CORE PERFETTO**.

Within FASE 1, the following has been completed:
1.  **Testing Automatico Completo**: A full backend test was run, with 27/34 tests passing (79.4% success), and all 5 new high-priority endpoints (gamification, Stripe, meal plans, dashboard) functioning.
2.  **Password Recovery**: Frontend screens (, ) and a link in  were added. Backend endpoints for this functionality were confirmed to already exist.
3.  **Error Handling Robusto**: A global exception handler was added to the backend (), and robust  blocks were integrated into critical endpoints like  and  to handle LiteLLM proxy token errors.
4.  **Bug Fixes**: Addressed a critical authentication error during shopping list generation and fixed a navigation issue where the Premium screen wouldn't go back after Stripe redirect (changed  to ).
5.  **Limiti Free vs Premium**: The  model in  was updated to track  and . Helper functions () were created and integrated into the  and  endpoints to enforce these limits. A new endpoint  was created to fetch current usage status.

The conversation then shifted to improving the core food recognition system, where a hybrid LogMeal API + GPT-4o Vision system was recommended by the AI and accepted by the user. The last action was a discussion about how to save the project (forking, GitHub push) as the user expressed confusion about the Fork button.
