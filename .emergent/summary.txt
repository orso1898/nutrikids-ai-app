<analysis>
The AI engineer iteratively developed the NutriKids AI application, starting with core features and responding to user feedback. Initial work included setting up the Expo/React Native frontend and FastAPI backend, integrating emergent LLM for chat and vision, and establishing basic navigation. Subsequent phases focused on implementing an Admin Configuration Panel, enhancing onboarding slides with images and animations, and, most significantly, a comprehensive internationalization (i18n) system for Italian, English, and Spanish. Debugging efforts addressed navigation issues (e.g., language selection flow after reset), UI presentation, and ensuring Coach Maya responded in the selected language. The latest major feature involved implementing a full authentication system with registration, login, password hashing, and a toggle for password visibility, along with creating an initial admin user. The work demonstrates a strong focus on user experience, responsiveness, and robust backend integration.

<product_requirements>
The NutriKids AI app, built with Expo and React Native, aims to provide nutritional guidance for children. Key features include:
- **Onboarding**: Animated slides with copyright-free images and multi-language greetings.
- **Authentication**: Email/password registration, login, and password recovery, with an admin user () for specific access. Local email validation was upgraded to backend API validation with password hashing.

- **Home Screen**: Six cards: Scanner, Coach Maya, Piani, Diario, Dashboard, Premium.
- **Design**: Teal color scheme, modern gradients, thumb-friendly UI.
- **Scanner**: AI dish recognition using  and backend vision AI.
- **Coach Maya**: Empathetic AI chatbot for nutritional advice, utilizing Emergent LLM.
- **Diario (Diary)**: Daily meal tracking with photo display, nutritional info, and a fully translated Aggiungi Pasto modal.
- **Premium**: Informative paywall screen with dynamic pricing (€5.99/month, €49.99/year) and translated features.
- **Profile**: Child management, logout, app reset functionality, and access to admin features.
- **Admin Functionality**: Admin Dashboard and Configuration Panel to manage API keys and pricing.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the Registration screen (), including validation and API calls.
-   Implement the Forgot Password and Reset Password functionalities.
-   Further debug the  for image analysis in  to move beyond the current fallback mechanism and ensure real AI analysis results are displayed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the new user registration feature. This involved:
1.  **Backend Implementation**: Already completed in previous steps, adding  model with password hashing and authentication endpoints (, , etc.) to .
2.  **Frontend Screen Creation**: A new screen, , was created. This screen is intended to provide the UI for new users to register.
3.  **Navigation Integration**: A Registrati (Register) link was added to the  screen, which navigates to the newly created  screen. This also involved adding new styles for this link.

The current state is that the  file has been created, and the  file has been updated to link to it. The next immediate step is to populate the  file with the necessary form elements, validation, and API integration logic.
